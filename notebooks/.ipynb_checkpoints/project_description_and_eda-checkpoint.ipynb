    "**Tax avoidance is not a crime!** Companies that carry out this act are on the verge of law. By definition: tax avoidance consists in carrying out economic activities in such a way that they are understood in a different way from tax regulations, in order to reduce the tax burden. International tax avoidance arose as a result of globalization and liberalization of economic systems of countries, weakening trade barriers and development of new technologies. Tax avoidance is achieved through aggressive **tax optimization** (e.g. tax havens, double taxation agreements, etc.). \n",
    "\n",
    "In this study, we will check whether we can **forecast for one year ahead the level of tax avoidance by a group of companies** listed on stock exchanges using shallow Machine Learning models. As the econometric research shows, this problem is non-trivial, and the most important determinants result from the financial statements per se. The question arises whether any additional data sources can be used to forecast this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many ways in the literature to measure tax avoidance. All of them have their advantages and disadvantages. However, the most popular metric appears to be Effective Tax Rate (ETR) = $\\dfrac{\\textrm{total tax expenses}}{\\textrm{pre-tax income}} $. Due to this formula, ETR has values in the range [0,1]. This measure applies directly to each jurisdiction and it is based on annual data published in the financial statements and this involves an annual change in the effective tax rate, or failure to determine it , in the case of negative income tax resulting from current tax overruns of deferred tax assets. ETR will be used as the target/endogenous variable in this study. Therefore, the following evaluation metrics for the given problem were selected: Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square error (RMSE). The choice was not accidental: MAE allows for relatively easy interpretation, while RMSE punishes model for large individual errors, which in the case of ETR forecasting may be crucial. For this case, absolute measures seem to be a more correct approach than relative ones. Nevertheless, the most important metric will be RMSE.\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem is a classic panel problem (many companies and many years)."

    "The database used in the study was created for the purposes of the paper \"Determinants of multinational tax avoidance\" (Agnieszka Teterycz, PhD. Anna Białek) on the basis of data retrieved from the Bloomberg database, OECD and PWC reports. Information on the introduction of regulations concerning foreign controlled companies (CFCs) in the analysed countries has been selected from OECD reports. From the reports prepared by PWC, data specifying the number of double taxation agreements signed in the analysed countries were selected. The dataset gather companies included in WIG, DAX, UK100, CAC40 and ATX indices listed on stock exchanges in Poland, Germany, Great Britain, France and Austria in 2005-2017. All companies from the financial (including banks) and insurance sectors were excluded from the analysis, as well as those with missing data in the explanatory variables. In addition, the observations that took a negative value for the financial result before tax and income tax were removed in order to avoid situations where a negative value of ETR would be difficult to interpret. The above exclusions and removal of outlier observations reduced the sample for panel data from 7 800 to 4 719 observations. Panel data are balanced (13 years x 363 companies). Inputation process was applied - using medians and means at the company level. Authors also used fill forward interpolation at the beginning of the time series."

In addition, company names (tickers) are not perfect and in some cases it is very difficult to find the right company on websites such as: stooq.pl. Therefore, the bulk approach is not optimal, and manual download would take too much time. Therefore, it was decided to choose variables that will testify to the condition of selected stock exchanges and the entire economy in each country."
